# Contributing to GDMP
Thanks for taking the time to contribute to GDMP. There are a few things that you can help to make the project better:

## Bug fixes and new features
If you found a bug or want a new feature, please open the issue to let us know, it would be advised to search for previous issues to see if it already exists before opening a new one.
You can also open the pull request for the issue to get your improvement merged.
## Cross-platform development
While development on Linux is fine by using VSCode with clangd compilation database, it can be improved on other platforms such as Windows and MacOS.
If you managed to setup the development environment for other platforms and want to contribute, feel free to open the issue/pull request so that we can discuss how we can integrate it into the repository.
## iOS support
The current iOS support is very primitive and I'm unable to maintain it, if you want to help improving iOS-specific code or build process it would be appreciated.
## And the other!
Got any idea or suggestion? You can also share your thought by opening the issue to discuss with us.
